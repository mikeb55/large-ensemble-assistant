## Promotional Blurb

> *The Master's Palette* is a kaleidoscopic journey through four sound-worlds — 
> Mingus's blues spirituality, Gil Evans's pastel orchestrations, Bartók's 
> nocturnal mysteries, and the Klangfarbenmelodie tradition. Scored for an 
> innovative hybrid ensemble of classical guitar with winds and strings, this 
> 8-minute work offers professional chamber groups a fresh, colorful addition 
> to the contemporary repertoire.
