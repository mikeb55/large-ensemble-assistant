## Overall Character

This work explores four distinct sound-worlds unified by motivic transformation:
- **Blues cell** (C-Eb-F): minor 3rd + major 2nd
- **Long-line cell**: stepwise descending gestures
- **Bartók cell**: chromatic clusters and tritones
- **Inversion cell**: transformed motifs in coalescence

## Movement Notes

### I. Mingus Blues Cathedral (m.1-12)
- **Character:** Gospel warmth, blues inflection
- **Tempo:** q=92, steady but with natural swing feel
- **Balance:** Flugelhorn leads; all others supportive (pp-mp)
- **Special:** Bass Poetry (m.3) is independent, singing — not reactive
- **Climax:** m.10-11, unified attack, registral lift

### II. Gil's Orchestral Canvas (m.13-16)
- **Character:** Floating, pastel, ethereal
- **Tempo:** q=66, molto rubato permitted
- **Balance:** Violin solo at m.15 is EMOTIONAL CENTER
- **Special:** m.15 "fragile, senza vibrato" — exposed, vulnerable
- **Color:** Guitar shimmer (harmonics), strings sul tasto

### III. Bartók Night Music (m.17-20)
- **Character:** Pointillistic, eerie, nocturnal
- **Tempo:** q=84, but flexible within bars
- **Balance:** Sparse — each entry matters
- **Special:** m.19 is STRUCTURAL SILENCE — hold fermata, breathe together
- **Color:** Flutter-tongue, harmonics, col legno, sul pont.

### IV. Klangfarbenmelodie II (m.21-25)
- **Character:** Timbral passing, building to apotheosis
- **Tempo:** q=72 → 92, pressing forward to Chorale
- **Balance:** Each instrument takes the melody briefly
- **Special:** Cello inverted motif (m.22) is FEATURED
- **Climax:** m.24-25 CHORALE — full ensemble, triumphant, then morendo release

## Balance Intentions

- **Primary lines:** Always mf or above
- **Supporting voices:** pp-mp, never louder than lead
- **Guitar:** Sempre sotto voce except Chorale
- **Bass:** Harmonic pillar, not melodic competitor
- **Strings:** Open voicing, avoid mid-register mud

---

## Technical Notes

- **Winds:** Breath marks provided; additional breaths permitted at phrase ends
- **Strings:** Bowings are suggestions; adjust for comfort
- **Guitar:** All positions I-III unless marked; con pedale throughout
- **Cello:** 1st-4th position; no awkward shifts during phrases
