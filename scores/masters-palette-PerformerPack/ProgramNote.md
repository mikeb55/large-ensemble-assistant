*The Master's Palette* reimagines the colors and textures of four influential 
musical voices: Charles Mingus's blues-drenched spirituality, Gil Evans's 
orchestral impressionism, Béla Bartók's nocturnal sound-world, and the 
Klangfarbenmelodie tradition of passing melodies through shifting timbres.

The work unfolds in four connected movements. The **Mingus Blues Cathedral** 
opens with a growling cello pedal and gospel-inflected flugelhorn, establishing 
a blues cell (C-Eb-F) that will transform throughout the piece. **Gil's 
Orchestral Canvas** floats in pastel textures, with a fragile violin solo 
at its emotional center. The **Bartók Night Music** scatters pointillistic 
gestures across the ensemble, punctuated by moments of profound silence. 
Finally, **Klangfarbenmelodie II** passes a single melodic line through 
rotating instrumental colors before coalescing into a triumphant chorale.

The hybrid guitar-chamber scoring — classical guitar alongside winds and 
strings — creates a unique sonic palette that bridges jazz, classical, and 
contemporary chamber traditions.
