## Instrument-Specific Guidelines

### Flute
- **Bright upper register** (C5-C7): projecting, singing
- **Middle register** (G4-C5): warm, blending
- **Low register** (C4-G4): breathy, quiet, avoid in tutti
- Avoid rapid passages in extreme low
- Flutter tongue effective in all registers
- Harmonics available (octave, 12th)

### Clarinet in Bb
- **Clarino register** (written G5+): brilliant, penetrating
- **Throat tones** (written Bb4-C5): weaker, use carefully
- **Chalumeau** (written E3-Bb4): dark, rich, mysterious
- Full dynamic range in all registers
- Excellent for long legato lines
- Write transposed M2 higher than sounding

### Flugelhorn in Bb
- **Sweet spot** (written G4-D5): warm, lyrical, vocal
- **Upper register** (written E5+): more effort, use sparingly
- **Low register** (written F#3-F4): dark, soft
- More mellow than trumpet
- Excellent for cantabile melodies
- Write transposed M2 higher than sounding
- Mutes: straight, cup, harmon available

### Violin
- **Brilliant upper** (E6-E7): intense, exposed
- **Singing middle** (A4-E6): most expressive range
- **Rich low** (G3-A4): warm, darker
- Double stops: 3rds, 6ths, octaves most natural
- Sul tasto, sul ponticello, pizz, harmonics available
- Divisi possible in ensemble context

### Viola
- **Alto voice specialist**: inner harmony, countermelody
- **C string** (C3-G3): dark, rich, cello-like
- **Upper register** (D5+): intense, exposed
- Often overlooked—give important lines!
- Double stops available
- Same techniques as violin

### Cello
- **Tenor voice** (G3-D5): singing, expressive
- **Bass register** (C2-G3): foundational
- **Thumb position** (D5+): intense, violin-like
- Excellent for solo melodies
- Pizz very effective for bass lines
- Can play both bass and tenor roles

### Double Bass
- **Foundation** (E1-G2): orchestral anchor
- **Middle register** (A2-D3): more audible, melodic
- **Upper register** (E3+): solo, exposed
- Pizz is standard in jazz contexts
- Arco for sustained passages
- Write 8ve higher than sounding

### Guitar
- **Fingerstyle**: arpeggios, broken chords
- **Chord voicings**: 4-6 voice chords
- **Single lines**: melodic passages
- **Harmonics**: bell-like effects
- Avoid rapid position shifts
- Consider fingering practicality
- Natural resonance in open position
- Write 8ve higher than sounding

## Orchestration Priorities

### 1. Balance
- No instrument buried in texture
- Lead voice clearly audible
- Bass audible but not overwhelming
- Inner voices present but supporting

### 2. Color
- Vary timbres throughout
- Combine instruments for new colors
- Use extended techniques for variety
- Contrast sections with different scorings

### 3. Transparency
- When needed, thin the texture
- Solo + accompaniment passages
- Avoid constant tutti
- Let important lines breathe

### 4. Build/Release Architecture
- Plan dynamic and textural arcs
- Climaxes should be earned
- Quiet moments equally important
- Pacing serves the musical narrative

### 5. Vertical Spacing
- Avoid muddy low register stacking
- Keep clarity in middle voices
- High register for brilliance, not clutter
- Bass should have room to speak

---

## Common Combinations

### Warm/Blend
- Flute + Viola (octaves)
- Clarinet + Cello (unison/3rds)
- Flugelhorn + Violin (melody)

### Bright/Brilliant
- Flute + Violin (octaves high)
- Clarinet clarino + Flugelhorn

### Dark/Rich
- Clarinet chalumeau + Viola
- Cello + Bass (octaves)
- Guitar + Cello

### Pointillistic
- Pizz strings + guitar harmonics
- Flute staccato + clarinet staccato
- Solo instruments trading phrases

---

## Voice Leading

1. Smooth connections between chords
2. Avoid parallel 5ths/octaves (unless stylistic)
3. Common tones held where possible
4. Bass moves purposefully
5. Inner voices move minimally

---

## Practical Considerations

### Page Turns
- Rest before page turn in parts
- Minimum 2 bars rest for turn

### Breathing (Winds/Brass)
- Mark breath points
- Stagger breathing in long passages
- Don't write endless phrases without rest

### Bowing (Strings)
- Consider bow changes
- Mark important bowings
- Phrase with bow in mind

### Fingering (Guitar)
- Keep positions practical
- Allow time for shifts
- Avoid stretches beyond 4 frets
