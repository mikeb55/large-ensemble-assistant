# Anti-Repetition & Humanity Rules
Version: 2025.12.12

---

## Core Principle

Every piece of music must feel **human**, not machine-generated.
Each movement must **evolve**, never stagnate.

---

## Forbidden Patterns (AI Slop)

### Never Allow:
- 1-2 bar loops without variation
- Scalar noodling (running up and down scales)
- Predictable sequences (exact transposition with no change)
- Random chords with no functional/color logic
- Mechanical repetition (copy-paste)
- Bland accompaniment (whole notes only)
- Quantized rhythms (perfectly even, robotic)
- Generic arpeggios (1-3-5-8 patterns)
- Clichéd progressions without purpose

---

## Required Variation Types

### 1. Rhythmic Variation
- Displace accents
- Add syncopation
- Change subdivision
- Rubato moments
- Augmentation/diminution

### 2. Registral Variation
- Octave displacement
- Inversion of intervals
- Expand/contract range
- Shift melody to different octave
- Exchange between voices

### 3. Timbral Variation
- Arco ↔ pizzicato
- Sul tasto ↔ sul ponticello
- Muted ↔ open
- Flutter tongue
- Harmonics
- Different instruments take same melody

### 4. Harmonic Variation
- Unexpected reharmonization
- Modal interchange
- Chromatic alteration
- Add/remove tensions
- Change bass note (slash chords)

### 5. Textural Variation
- Thin out to solo
- Build to tutti
- Change voicing density
- Add countermelody
- Remove voices strategically

## Phrase Shape Requirements

Every phrase MUST follow: **lift → arc → release**

### Lift (Anacrusis)
- Energy builds into downbeat
- Could be pickup notes
- Creates forward momentum

### Arc (Peak)
- Dynamic and/or registral climax
- Tension point of phrase
- Most expressive moment

### Release (Resolution)
- Energy dissipates
- Cadential gesture
- Breath before next phrase

---

## Breath Points

### Required:
- Phrase endings (obvious rest or longer note)
- Before new sections
- Between call and response
- After climactic moments

### Implementation:
- Actual rests in the music
- Longer note values at phrase ends
- Breath marks for winds
- Lift marks for strings
- Dynamic decay (diminuendo to breath)

---

## Movement Requirements

Each movement MUST have:

### 1. A Distinctive Gesture
- Signature motif
- Unique rhythmic figure
- Characteristic interval
- Recognizable identity

### 2. A Contrasting Middle Section
- Different texture
- Different tempo/feel
- Different key/mode
- Different dynamic level
- Provides relief from A sections

### 3. A Developmental Section (if appropriate)
- Motivic fragmentation
- Sequence and transformation
- Building tension
- Contrapuntal complexity
- Resolution to recap

---

## Human Expression Markers

### Dynamic Nuance
- Not just p, mf, f
- Include: pp, mp, mf, f, ff
- Hairpins for shape
- Subito dynamics for surprise
- Terraced dynamics for contrast

### Agogic Accents
- Slight lengthening of important notes
- Rubato indications (poco rit., a tempo)
- Tenuto for weight without accent

### Articulation Variety
- Staccato vs. legato
- Accents on unexpected beats
- Marcato for drive
- Portato for in-between

### Tempo Flexibility
- rit. / accel. / a tempo
- Tempo changes between sections
- Fermatas for drama
- poco meno mosso for lyrical moments

## Self-Check Questions

Before finalizing any output, ask:

1. Would a human musician enjoy playing this?
2. Can I hum the main melody after one hearing?
3. Is there anywhere the music feels stuck or looping?
4. Are there natural breathing places?
5. Does every section feel different from the last?
6. Would I want to hear this piece twice?
7. Is there a moment that gives me chills?
8. Does the ending feel earned and satisfying?

If any answer is NO → revise before output.

## Red Flags Checklist

Immediately fix if present:

- [ ] More than 2 bars of exact repetition
- [ ] Melody is just scale fragments
- [ ] Bass only plays roots on beat 1
- [ ] No dynamic markings for 8+ bars
- [ ] All rhythms are even subdivisions
- [ ] No articulation variety
- [ ] Texture never changes
- [ ] Same register throughout
- [ ] No expressive text
- [ ] Ending is abrupt or formulaic
