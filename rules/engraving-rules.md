## General Standards

1. Follow professional engraving conventions
2. Use correct clefs (never put notes below A3 in treble)
3. Maintain clean spacing throughout
4. No collisions with slurs, dynamics, or articulations
5. Ensure readable system breaks (typically every 4 bars)
6. Clear layout for multi-movement works

|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Flute      | Treble       | —              |

| Viola      | Alto         | Treble (high passages) |
| Cello      | Bass         | Tenor, Treble  |
| Double Bass| Bass         | Tenor (rare)   |
| Guitar     | Treble (8vb) | —              |

### Clef Change Rules
- Change clef when passage stays in new register for 4+ bars
- Avoid clef changes mid-phrase
- Place clef change at barline when possible

---

## Dynamics Placement

### Winds/Brass
- Place dynamics **above** the staff
- Align horizontally with the note they affect
- Hairpins above staff, spanning affected notes

### Strings
- Place dynamics **below** the staff
- Align horizontally with the note they affect
- Hairpins below staff

### General Rules
- Never stack dynamics vertically
- Dynamics should not collide with:
  - Slurs
  - Articulation marks
  - Text expressions
  - Chord symbols

---

## Text Placement

### Movement Titles
- Centered above first system
- Bold, 14-18pt font
- Include movement number: "I. Mingus Blues Cathedral"

### Tempo Marks
- Bold, above first bar
- Include metronome mark: **Slow gospel blues ♩= 54**
- Place above all dynamics

### Expressive Text
- Italic font (dolce, sul tasto, con fuoco, etc.)
- Place above staff for all instruments
- Align with the note where expression begins

### Rehearsal Marks
- Boxed letters or numbers
- Consistent distance above system
- Place at structural points (new sections, returns)

---

## Slurs and Ties

### Slur Placement
- Curve away from noteheads
- Avoid crossing stems when possible
- Endpoint should be near notehead, not stem

### Tie Rules
- Ties connect same pitches
- Curved in same direction as slurs
- Do not cross barlines visually (break at barline)

---

## Articulation Placement

| Articulation | Placement |
|--------------|-----------|
| Staccato     | Near notehead, opposite stem |
| Accent       | Near notehead, opposite stem |
| Tenuto       | Near notehead, opposite stem |
| Fermata      | Above staff (always) |
| Marcato      | Near notehead, opposite stem |

### Stacking Order (from note outward)
1. Articulation
2. Slur
3. Dynamic
4. Text

---

## System Breaks

- Typical: every 4 bars
- Adjust for phrase structure (break at phrase ends)
- Never break in the middle of a tied note
- Allow for page turns in parts

---

## Spacing

### Horizontal Spacing
- Notes spaced proportionally to duration
- Leave room for accidentals
- Chord spacing: tighter for close voicings

### Vertical Spacing
- Staff distance: 7-10 mm typical
- System distance: 12-15 mm typical
- Avoid collisions between systems
